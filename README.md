# Birthday-Mixed-Reality-Extension
Test MRE for me to learn how to build them.

Used Mixed-Reality-Extension-SDK and Mixed-Reality-Extension-SDK-Samples for code and reference. 
Relies heavilly on the two respositories.

Pseudocode:

public:
    index.html -> gives "caption" to mre in html
    manifest.json -> tells user what code is made for
    cupcake.glb

scripts:
    .gitignore ->
    build-all.js ->
    change-sdk-source.js -> change-source.js
    foreach-sample.js -> for-each-run.js ->
    install-all.js -> 
    package-lock.json ->
    package.json ->
    sdk-path-config-sample.json ->

src:
    app.ts -> main code for the mre -> defines what mre does
    server.ts -> maon code for accessing/making server

.vscode:
    launch.json ->
    settings.json ->
    tasks.json ->

.gitignore ->

.editorconfig -> shows stylistically wha tall files should look like

DEVELOPER.md ->

package.json -> tells user about entire package and its details

README -> includes pseudocode and what the code actually abouts

.dockerignore ->

eslintrc.js -> 

Dockerfile ->

azure-pipelines.yml ->

package-lock.json ->

tsconfig.json ->
