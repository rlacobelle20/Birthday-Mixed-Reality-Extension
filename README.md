# Birthday-Mixed-Reality-Extension
Test MRE for me to learn how to build them.

Pseudocode:

public:
    index.html -> gives "caption" to mre in html
    manifest.json -> tells user what code is made for

scripts:

src:
    app.ts -> main code for the mre -> defines what mre does
    server.ts -> maon code for accessing/making server

editorconfig -> shows stylistically wha tall files should look like

package.json -> tells user about entire package and its details

README -> includes pseudocode and what the code actually abouts
